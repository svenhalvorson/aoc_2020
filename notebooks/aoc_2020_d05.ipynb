    "So here we have some problem about finding a location on a $2^n$x$2^m$ grid. We have codes that are basically binary and they describe it as something like 101 corresponds to the top half, then the bottom half of the remaining, and then the top half of the last partition. We have some codes and basically have to find the largest value of some kind of check sum.\n",
